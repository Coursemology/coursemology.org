# Introduction

Coursemology, an open source online education platform for school :-)

# Quick start
To get started, you will need to complete this checklist:

    1. Clone the repository
    2. Created a Facebook app and retrive it `App ID` and `App secret`

Setting up

    $ cp sample_config/facebook.yml.sample config/facebook.yml
    # Edit the file using the Facebook app's ID and secret

    $ cp sample_config/devise_initializer.rb.sample config/initializers/devise.rb
    # Edit the file (mailer_sender, omniauth)

    # Set 2 environment variables: GMAIL_SMTP_USER and GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD
    # either just run this commands or add them into a .rvmrc file
    $ export GMAIL_SMTP_USER='your_email@gmail.com'
    $ export GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD='your_password'

    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:create # Do it for the first time
    $ rake db:migrate
    $ rake db:seed
    $ rake db:gen_fake_data # Creates sample courses & users for you, takes a few minutes

    # The app performance can be monitored by adding newrelic config file:
    # config/newrelic.yml

# Testing on your local machine

There is one super user added through db:seed
    username: jfdi@academy.com
    pass: supersecretpass

# Checking available API / routes:
    $ rake routes

# Self deploying Ruby on Rails app with Phusion Messenger
