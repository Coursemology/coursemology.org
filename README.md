# Introduction

Coursemology, an open source online education platform for school :-)

# Quick Start
To get started, you will need to do the following:

    1. Clone the repository
    2. Created a Facebook app and retrive it `App ID` and `App secret`

## Setting up

    $ cp sample_config/facebook.yml.sample config/facebook.yml
    # Edit the file to use your own Facebook App ID and secret

    $ cp sample_config/devise_initializer.rb.sample config/initializers/devise.rb
    # Edit the file (mailer_sender, omniauth)

    # Set 2 environment variables: GMAIL_SMTP_USER and GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD
    # either just run this commands or add them into a .rvmrc file
    $ export GMAIL_SMTP_USER='your_email@gmail.com'
    $ export GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD='your_password'

    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:create # Do it for the first time
    $ rake db:schema:load
    $ rake db:seed
    $ rake db:populate_course_pref
    $ rake db:gen_fake_data # Creates sample courses & users for you, takes a few minutes

    # The app performance can be monitored by adding newrelic config file:
    # config/newrelic.yml

# `clockwork` and `delayed_job`

Coursemology has got various tasks that need to be run at various intervals; the `clockwork` and `delayed_job` gems are used for this purpose. These need setting up to run alongside your application instance.

Run these tasks from your source checkout directory when your application is launched

    $ script/delayed_job start
    $ clockworkd -c lib/clock.rb --pid-dir=tmp/pids start

To terminate them (for upgrading or reloading)

    $ script/delayed_job stop
    $ clockworkd -c lib/clock.rb --pid-dir=tmp/pids stop

# Testing on your local machine

One Superuser is added during `rake db:seed`.

    username: jfdi@academy.com
    password: supersecretpass

# Checking available API / routes:
    $ rake routes

# Self deploying Rails apps with Phusion Messenger

In case you are trying to deploy the website yourself using Passenger (aka mod_rails), here is a good guide to get started:

# Production builds

Coursemology utilises the Rails assets pipeline. Also, changes might require schema migrations. Run them all on your deployment servers using the following comments

    $ rake db:migrate db:seed db:populate_course_pref
    $ rake tmp:cache:clear assets:clean:all assets:precompile:all
