Coursemology is an open source gamified learning platform that enables educators to increase student engagement and make learning fun.

## Setting up Coursemology

There are two ways to setup a local development instance of Coursemology. You can either use Vagrant and Ansible to automate the setup or you can do it manually.

### With Vagrant

#### Requirements

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
3. [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)

#### Setting up 

    cd coursemology.org
    vagrant up
    # Grab a cup of coffee

Once the virtual machine is provisioned, you may ssh into the virtual machine and start running the server.

    vagrant ssh
    cd coursemology
    rails s

### Manually without Vagrant

#### Requirements

1. Ruby and Ruby on Rails (3.2.14)
2. MySQL

Setting up a Ruby on Rails environment is pretty involved. You may follow the instructions on [GoRails](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.10-yosemite) for your own operating system.

#### Setting up

    cp sample_config/facebook.yml.sample config/facebook.yml
    cp sample_config/devise_initializer.rb.sample config/initializers/devise.rb
    cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
    # Change the username and password in the development section as appropriate

    bundle install
    rake db:setup db:migrate db:populate_course_pref db:gen_fake_data
    rails s

## Testing on your local machine

A Superuser is added during `rake db:seed`.

    username: jfdi@academy.com
    password: supersecretpass
