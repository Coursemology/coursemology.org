    # when there are multiple answer for one question, only the one
    # that is counted is graded (and attached with the grading)

    # Strategy: mark again every time I receive a new answer
    # - Get all student answers for the question
    # - Get all possible answers for the question
    # - Find the first answer that is correct
    #   + First try => 2pts
    #   + If all wrong answers are ticked off => 0pt
    #   + Otherwise 1pt
