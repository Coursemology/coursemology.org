== Introduction

Coursemology, an open source online education platform for school :-)

== Setting up

        $ bundle install
        $ rake db:migrate
        $ rake db:seed

Using rails console to test
        $ rails c

Running local server
        $ rails s

== Testing

Populate sample data:
        $ rake db:gen_fake_data
This might take some times, so be patient :)

There is one super user added through db:seed
        username: jfdi@academy.com
        pass: supersecretpass

== Configuration

You need to set the following environment variable
        GMAIL_SMTP_USER
        GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD

so that the website can send out email successfully.

Update Devise configuration:
        cp devise_sample_config.rb config/initializers/devise.rb

Then update the email used, the facebook app info in the config file above.

== Checking available API / routes:
        $ rake routes

== Self deploying Ruby on Rails app with Phusion Messenger

In case you are trying to deploy the website yourself using Phusion Messenger, here is a good guide to get started.
